##How long it takes

There is no standard processing time, but youâ€™ll usually be told whether your application has been successful within 6 months.

Your application may take longer if your case is complex, for example:

- if your supporting documents need to be verified
- if you need to attend an interview
- because of your personal circumstances, for example if you have a criminal conviction
